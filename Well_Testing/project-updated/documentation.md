  - Transmissibility
  - Mobility Parameter
  - Diffusivity
  - Storage Coefficient
  - Skin Factor

- **Visualization**:
  - Specialized plots for each flow regime
  - Trend line visualization
  - Interpretation guidance

## Technical Implementation

The update includes several new components and utilities:

- `timeFunctions.ts`: Implements various time function calculations
- `closureAnalysis.ts`: Provides closure detection and analysis methods
- `afterClosureAnalysis.ts`: Implements after-closure flow regime detection and permeability calculation
- `InteractivePlot.tsx`: Component for interactive plot features
- `ClosureAnalysis.tsx`: Component for closure analysis visualization
- `AfterClosureAnalysis.tsx`: Component for after-closure analysis visualization

The existing components have been updated to integrate these new features:

- `DataInputForm.tsx`: Updated to make flow rate optional for DFIT
- `DiagnosticPlots.tsx`: Enhanced with multiple time functions and interactive features
- `WellTestDetails.tsx`: Updated to include closure and after-closure analysis for DFIT tests
- `plotUtils.ts`: Extended with new plot types and time function support

## Conclusion

These updates significantly enhance the DFIT analysis capabilities of the application, providing more flexibility in data input and more powerful analysis tools. The interactive features allow for more detailed examination of pressure data, while the closure and after-closure analysis provide valuable insights into reservoir properties.
