# Project Update Todo List

## Phase 1: Analyze the current project structure and understand the codebase
- [x] Extract and examine the project files
- [x] Understand the current DFIT implementation
- [x] Identify components that need to be modified
- [x] Understand the current plotting implementation

## Phase 2: Modify DFIT functionality to not require rate data
- [x] Update the DataInputForm component to make flow rate optional for DFIT
- [x] Modify the dfitAnalysis.ts utility to work without rate data
- [x] Update the TestData type to reflect optional flow rate for DFIT
- [x] Test the modified DFIT functionality

## Phase 3: Implement enhanced derivative plotting with multiple time functions
- [x] Add time function selection options to the DiagnosticPlots component
- [x] Implement different time function calculations in plotUtils.ts
- [x] Add Primary Pressure Derivative (dP) plotting capability
- [x] Add raw Pressure plotting capability
- [x] Update the plot rendering to support the new plot types

## Phase 4: Add interactive plot features for slope definition and point flagging
- [x] Implement click-and-drag functionality for defining slopes on plots
- [x] Add point flagging capability for significant pressure points
- [x] Create a comment/annotation system for flagged points
- [x] Implement visual indicators for slopes and flagged points

## Phase 5: Implement closure analysis functionality
- [x] Create a new ClosureAnalysis component
- [x] Implement G-function, square-root time, and log-log closure analysis methods
- [x] Add closure pressure detection algorithms
- [x] Create interactive closure point selection capability
- [x] Implement closure results display

## Phase 6: Implement after-closure analysis for impulse linear and radial flow
- [x] Create an AfterClosureAnalysis component
- [x] Implement impulse linear flow analysis
- [x] Implement impulse radial flow analysis
- [x] Add permeability calculation from after-closure data
- [x] Create visualization for after-closure analysis results

## Phase 7: Test the updated application and fix any issues
- [x] Test all new features with sample data
- [x] Verify DFIT works without rate data
- [x] Test interactive plotting features
- [x] Verify closure analysis functionality
- [x] Test after-closure analysis
- [x] Fix any identified issues

## Phase 8: Deliver the updated project to the user
- [ ] Package the updated project
- [ ] Create documentation for the new features
- [ ] Deliver the final product to the user
